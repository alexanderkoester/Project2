            <h1>Posca</h1>

            <p>Launched in the early 80s, the POSCA paint marker was an immediate success among the artistic communities arising from urban cultures, and especially the Graffiti community. Graffiti artists gave it real popularity, which gradually spread beyond the urban space. Studio artists began to go outside and try their hands at street art, while graffiti artists started working on canvas. These exchanges between one artistic community and another are the source of POSCA's universal credibility, which has continued to win over new users ever since. From Street Art to Fine Art via Illustration, Graffiti, Portraits and all forms of Customisation, POSCA now drives artistic momentum among all creators in all media.

            <h1>Marker</h1>

            <p>These opaque felt tip markers can write on a variety of surfaces including plastic, metal, wood, glass, plaster, canvas and more. Paint can be scraped off from nonporous surfaces like glass, etc. But will adhere Permanently to porous surfaces such as wood, paper, etc. Water-based pigment ink is non-toxic, lightfast and waterproof. The ink won't bleed through paper (unlike Alcohol-based markers) and is excellent for vibrant signs and craft work.</p>
