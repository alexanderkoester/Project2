        <h1>Molotow</h1>

        <p>Together with the most prominent graffiti artists, Jürgen developed the first prototypes of graffiti optimized spray cans this meant: less spray mist, sharp edges and cans without mixing balls. With a spark of ideas, Jürgen leveled the ground for the whole movement.With the worldwide first aerosol without mixing balls, the brand MOLOTOW was born and its logo for the first time on the backside of the label. Till today this spray can is reference product no. 1 for real action. Further innovations were not long in coming and the first artist spray can for precise, urban art was born the MOLOTOW PREMIUM. Together with the then following ONE4ALL acrylic markers, this spray can was the flagship and the guideline for future color concepts on the art market.</p>

        <h1>One 4 All</h1>
