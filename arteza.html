            <h1>Arteza</h1>

            <p>It's with great pride that we announce Arteza has been named #32 on the prestigious 2020 Inc. 5000 list. This list ranks the top 5,000 privately-owned companies in the United States, based on their revenue growth over the past three years. Thanks to our loyal customers and exceptional team members, our company has seen phenomenal growth for which we're now being recognized. Arteza is based in Miami, the gateway to Latin America, and in just a few short years has grown to become a reckoning force within the art supply industry by offering outstanding customer service and quality products at affordable prices. </p>

            <h1>Marker</h1>

            <p>These versatile paint markers will work on surfaces like paper, glass, rocks, wood, metal, plastic, and more. No need to get separate glass paint or paint for ceramics, these markers can do it all. Each marker features a chisel tip and a rounded tip so that you can create both wide and thin lines while drawing. These pens are filled with acrylic paint that's opaque and acid-free for the best non-fading surface coverage. You won't have to worry about waiting a long time for your artwork to be ready due to the quick-drying formula. Enjoy all the fun of painting without the mess of getting water cups or paintbrushes.</p>
